                and locale information based on your IP address. If IP addresses or similar identifiers are
                considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal
                information. Our site collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of user
                visits to our website and its components, which products are added to the cart, which contests
                you’ve participated in, which products and articles are accessed through our services, and the
                length and time a user may spend browsing those products and articles. We use this
                information to provide a personalized experience to our users and to improve our services. For
                instance, if you add a product to your cart and the payment fails for some reason, we may send

                3.Cookie Policy
                <br>
                <br>
                ● Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or device to
                enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our
                website are visited and by how many people.
                <br>
                <br>
                ● Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent or
                limit your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the
                sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each
                new cookie in a variety of ways. You may wish to leave the cookies activated because
                cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Site’s most essential features.
                <br>
                <br>
                4.Sharing of your personal information
                <br>
                ● Personal Information will only be shared by Company to provide or improve our products,
                services, and to contact you about our services; it will not be shared with third parties
                for their marketing purposes.
                <br>
                <br>
                ● Others: We may access, read, preserve, disclose, or release Personal Information when
                we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law and enforce or
                apply our Terms of Use; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our
                employees, our users, or others.

                <br>
                5.Security of your personal information
                <br>
                <br>
                We allow you to limit access to your account via a password for your privacy and security. If
                you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or
                different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You are responsible for
                ensuring against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting
                and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting
                access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your
                account.

                ● We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to encrypt your Personal
                Information during transmission. However, because no data transmission over the
                Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is
                impenetrable, Company cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information in its
                possession or the security of its servers or databases. Unauthorized entry or use,
                hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user
                information at any time.
                <br>
                <br>
                ● In the unlikely event that Company believes that the security of your Personal
                Information in its possession or control may have been compromised, Company may
                seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, Company may notify you by email,
                messaging to your device, or other means within 84 hours of data compromise.

                11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
                post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
                company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting
                personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy
                on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it
                is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
                According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
                <br>
                <br>
                0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;
                <br>
                <br>
                0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the
                home page of our website;
                <br>
                <br>
                0.3.users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;
                <br>
                <br>
                0.4.users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at privacy@carttart.com
                Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals: We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies,
                or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is
                a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be
                tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of
                your web browser.

                12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

                delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make
                certain requests and ask us:

                <br>
                0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will
                return to you:

                rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be
                limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.
                <br>
                <br>
                0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete
                the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our
                records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may
                be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete
                your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require
                your personal information to operate.
                <br>
                <br>
                0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your
                personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your
                personal
                information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a
                transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies,
                without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You
                are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any
                time.
                If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such
                transfers.
                Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with
                us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which
                require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will
                discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
                To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s)
                by email: privacy@carttart.com.
