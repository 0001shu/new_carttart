        <h1>Power of Renewables</h1>
        <p>Renewable energy is derived from wind, solar, hydro, and other natural sources. 
            Unlike fossil fuels, which deplete over time and harm the environment, 
            renewables offer a clean, inexhaustible energy supply that reduces carbon 
            emissions and combats climate change. Businesses and governments investing in renewable technologies benefit 
            from lower long-term energy costs, energy independence, and job creation in green industries. 
            Advances in battery storage and smart grid technology are making renewables more reliable 
            than ever, addressing the challenge of intermittent supply.
