              <h5 class="card-description1">
                RTS is a subgenre of strategy video games that does not progress incrementally in turns, but
                allows all players to play simultaneously, in "real time". This challenges players to think
                strategically and make quick decisions under pressure. It fosters teamwork and
                competitive spirit, making it an engaging and rewarding experience. Esports RTS titles like StarCraft
                II, Age of Empires, and Warcraft III have built a legacy of intense, high-level competition.
                Success in RTS games requires mastering macro-management (economy, resource gathering, and expansion)
                and micro-management (unit control and battle tactics).
